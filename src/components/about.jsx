                    <p style={{fontSize: "18px"}}> Im an avid programmer with 4 and half years of coding and computer engineering graduate student with a strong interest in AI engines and integrated circuit design. 
                    Since I was a little boy in Haiti, I have always nourished a strong passion for the core technologies that drive the World we live in today. 
                    That passion has drove me to pursue my dream program in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the second most prestious university in Taiwan.
                    However My journey across the globe was not without it's fair share of challenges. Those experiences shaped me unto the person Im today. 
                    So let's connect and have a chat!</p>
